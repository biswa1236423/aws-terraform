This is the easiest process setup EKS cluster in terraform.
After the setup of cluster , you can create your own YAML file using dry-run command
I am not creating an jenkins file for trigger of github URL and build pipeline.
But you can build any deployment through it also but its automatic not build  but its very easiy to setup and save our time.
